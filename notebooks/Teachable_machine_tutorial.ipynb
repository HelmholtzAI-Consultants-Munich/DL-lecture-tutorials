If the loss function is decreasing over time, it means that the network is learning.\n",

    "**Confusion matrix** Sometimes accuracy is not always enough to evaluate a model. Let's see that with an example. Assume that we have 10 patients and only one of them has a disease. If our model predicts that a patient is always healthy, it means that its accuracy would be $\\frac{9}{10} = 0.90$, which is pretty high, even if the model is not giving us relevant information. Indeed, in this case, we are more interested in detecting the disease instead of only having such high accuracy and missing relevant information.\n",
