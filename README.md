# DL-lecture-tutorials

We developed an inclusive crash course for the introduction to Deep Learning (DL) and its medical applications.
The goals of the lecture are:
- Demystify AI
- present applications to the medical domain
- show the power of DL
- introduce the challenges and current limitations of DL

The modularity of the lecture allows us to handle crowds of diverse, and even unknown, backgrounds, and to adapt it to different formats.
